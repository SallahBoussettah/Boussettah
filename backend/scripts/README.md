## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: Make sure your `.env` file is properly configured with database credentials.

2. **Destructive Operations**: The `resetDatabase.js` script will permanently delete all data. Use with caution.

3. **Seeding Order**: The `seedAll.js` script runs seeders in the correct order to avoid dependency issues.

4. **Database Connection**: All scripts automatically handle database connections and cleanup.

5. **Error Handling**: Scripts will exit with appropriate error codes and messages if something goes wrong.
